# AI-Powered Matchmaking Analytics

This project demonstrates advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques applied to matchmaking and networking scenarios. It showcases my expertise in AI/ML, data analytics, and visualization as a Technical Product Manager with a strong background in computer science.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs sophisticated analysis on user profile data for matchmaking purposes. The analysis includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Clustering analysis using K-means
- Visualization of multidimensional data
- Interpretation of PCA components

## Key Features

- **Advanced Data Processing**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applies PCA to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data while preserving important information.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Implements K-means clustering to group similar profiles together.
- **Data Visualization**: Creates informative plots to visualize cluster distributions and boundaries.
- **PCA Interpretation**: Provides insights into the most influential features in each principal component.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms (PCA, K-means, TF-IDF)
- Matplotlib for data visualization

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn)
3. Open the `advanced_matchmaking_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
4. Run the cells to see the analysis in action

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering)
- Integrate natural language processing for more nuanced text analysis
- Develop a recommendation system based on clustering results
- Create an interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration
